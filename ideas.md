This doc is devided into two parts: ideas,  suggestions and complaints
- **Ideas** : Polished **simple** ideas on how to make improvement based on the current version, comparably have more thinkings and discussions involved.
- **Suggestions**: Mostly "what if" ideas, not so polished, might need a lot of work for interation to integrate,  but it's fun to see what other players want.
- **Complaints**: Basically "I don't like XXX" posts, I collect the high frequency complaints among them.


## Ideas

1. IG's impact on the buildings
- **Issues**: IG should not stand by when buildings that harm their interests are expanding dramatically. In history, the scholar-bureucrat IG in China prevent railway building in China fiercely. 
- **Potential improvement**: Some IG group might have 1-2 buildings preference/hatred. When the IG has a majority impact in the goverment, the building might need more building power/resources to be accomplished. And this might also upset the IGs. And on the other hand, downgrade buildings might also have some impact, etc.
- **Good things about this change and potentials**
	- We can shape the difficulty of industrialization in the countries where conservative party have big impact. (like China, Japan before Meiji Era, etc).
	- Players need to think more when attempting to transform the production in the country
	- This is also a good start to shape how IG/pops can involve into the economy system. For eg, IG might be able to use the money in the investment pool to build things of their preference automatically.
- **Things needs to be polished more**: 
	- Players might feel extra burden be placed.

2. Production Proficiency 
- **Issues**: People expect more difference to be shaped on the building output even using the same production methods
- **Potential improvement**: Building might "accumulate proficiency" similiar to HOI4 production system. The longer time the building remains at the current production methond, the higher effiency it might have until it reaches a cap.
- **Good things about this change and potentials**
	- It can shape how people get used to the new production method.
	- Decisions that shift the buildings to the new production method might be more cautious as the proficiency might be lost.
	- Countries might have some special caps for some production methods to add flavors (which means they have special advantages on how to product it, like China on silk, etc).
- **Things needs to be polished more**: 
	- We suppose you do have a math model on how to balance the goods output, this system might make the maths even more complicated. (So that a ladder-shape function might help, like get +10% output after X years?)
	- Industrilized country might have even more advantages as they can jump to the new production method early to accumulate proficiency.

3. More interaction with the colonies/puppet countries
- **Issues**: The suzeraind should be able to invest, offer technical assistance and guide the production in the colony. 
- **Potential Improvment** : Simple changes might be investment or research modifiers like HOI4/EU4 puppet system. 


## Suggestions and Complaints

### Economy system
1. Dividing "tools" into "basic tools" and "complex machine tool" to shape light industry to more heavy industry in the later game.
2. Expect more people to be absorbed to the tertiary industry.
3. Factories revenue should be impacted more by the status of the market. If a factory can not get the resources, it should have close-to-0 output.
4. "Auto-investment" is essential to shape the investment intention from pops directly.



### Trade and Diplomacy
1. Foreign Investment: Similar to the "global bank" in V2.
- Infamy should not have very high gain in the area where superpower does not care.
- When you try to open the market of a country. Other country that want the goods from this market might also get involved.
- Might also get a clear text-description on what is the interest for a country. (where to expand, want to open which market) to make the player more involved.
- More precise market control: Embargo one good for one country, etc. The history fact: British and France have some goods totally banned while keep other goods free trades.

## War
- More detailed statistic on casualty: who died after a war. (current system just shows the number on the frontline ??? need to be confirmed.)
- Can we have a more reasonable logistic system, like supply depot in eu4, etc.
- More impact from the compostion of the army. 
- Though storage is removed in Vic3, specific storage for weapons still make sense. (Might set everything is storaged in the capical state just like Hoi4)
- Various way reflecting the revolt from natives. Might use the reduction of output/ damage to the building instead of war. 
- More orders on the frontline.
- World war system?
- Qing-Russia war. Manage a war on these wide frontline might be a nightmare and it might need really hard opeartion to avoid suffering from casualty in Siberia.

### Research System
- Data might still need re-balance. From the live it seems a little bit quicker than expected to get researches done.

## UI, Settings
- While we can quickly build things on the map, can we quickly cancel buildings in the queue on the big map? (like use right click)
- Chinese Map: Might refer to "The Historical Atlas of China", Tan Qixiang
- Culture map: can we see the culture of the most population in this area (just like vic 2)?
